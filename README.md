# Chit Picker 

## Background

The product is a Chit Picker (a random name selector, in reality) with a uniform probably to pick any name from a list. 

## Featuring

**A simple list of features are:**

* Ability to pick a name from a list of names with uniform probably
* To keep the selection fair, track total "picks" of a specific name and use that number of weight down the probability of selecting that name in the future
* Keep track of picks across multiple sessions
* Barchart of picks so that I can monitor fairness.
